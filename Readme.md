## About The Project 🌿
Herb Abhilekh is an Android application designed to bring radical transparency to the herbal and Ayurvedic products industry. In a market where authenticity and purity are paramount, consumers often have to blindly trust labels. This app solves that problem by leveraging blockchain technology to create an immutable, transparent, and verifiable record of each herb's journey.

From the moment a seed is planted to the final product on the shelf, every step is recorded on a decentralized ledger. By scanning a simple QR code on the product packaging, consumers can instantly access this complete history, ensuring they receive exactly what the label promises.

## Key Features ✨
📱 Instant QR Scanning: A fast and intuitive scanner serves as the gateway to the blockchain.

🌿 Full Provenance History: View the entire lifecycle of an herb, including cultivation details, harvest dates, processing methods, and quality certifications.

🔗 Blockchain Integrity: All data is secured on a blockchain, making it tamper-proof and guaranteeing authenticity.

📤 Data Contribution: A portal for verified cultivators and producers to securely upload data to the ledger.

✨ Modern, Native UI: Built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for a smooth, responsive, and modern user experience.

## Built With 🛠️
